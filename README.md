### 👋 Hi, I’m @charlesbthomas

I'm a Sr. Software Engineer and Software Architect based out of Nashville, TN!

Currently, I work as a Staff Software engineer at Iterable, building a workflow tool for the modern day marketer. I'm passionate about using the best methodologies, architectures, and technology to build awesome tools for people to use and enjoy, all with an awesome team. Today, that means I am using Scala, AWS, Typescript, React and other awesome tech!

Before all this, I went to school at Tennessee Tech University where I studied Computer Engineering and met my wife, Kelsey. Outside of work I enjoy gaming 🎮 , playing guitar 🎸, and eating Thai food 🍛.
